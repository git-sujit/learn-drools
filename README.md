# Business Rule Management System(BRMS): Drools


## Example
Consider a Jewellery shop which needs to maintain business logic of calculating discount based on the type of Jewellery. This can be done in our Java Code. But such rules may change daily and need to be updated regularly in our code which is not good. Also we will always require a Developer for making such changes. So its a good practice to define this logic as rules in a Business Rule Management System. If tomorrow the discount is to be changed this can be done even by a non technical person.
